Thanks for checking out our website! We want to share the nifty things we are working on, and give our members an opportunity to contribute to a knowledge collective through this club. 

Please browse the website for more information about who we are and what we do. If you are a NSC student and/or would like to collaborate, read on!

### Contributing

As much as possible, we would like to reserve contributing to our various projects to current NSC students. However, if you are not an enrolled NSC student but you would like to mentor us in a project or suggest an improvement, please open an issue or contact the team maintainer for the project.

**For Students:**

Welcome! Here are a few guidelines for contributing:
* Please be an active member of our club! We love face time even more than screen time, and we want to help you in any way we can! Only through coffee, laughter and lively conversation do we come up with the best ideas.
* To start working on one of our software projects or contribute documentation content, please fork the git repository. Once it is forked into your own GitHub account, you can clone the repo onto whichever local machine or online IDE you prefer. For example, to clone a fork of this repository, go to a terminal and type ```git clone https://www.github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/engineering-at-nsc.github.io.git```
* Please submit changes through pull requests; if you try to commit a change directly to the and do not already have privileges to do so, you will not be able to! Sad day. Instead, commit changes to your fork and open a pull request to have the changes migrated to the organization repository.
